	(1, 1, 1, 'Price is good. This is a really great monitor! The 19.5\' screen is great and at 1080p the resolution looks crisp. Fonts look sharp and clear. It has VGA support too which is great. The speakers are low on volume and you can barely hear anything.'),
	(2, 1, 1, 'The setup of the monitor is quite easy and the stand is quite sturdy. The panel is poorly designed. Overall, the resolution, price and colors are great and I haven\'t had any troubles using it.  However the screen gets dirty very quickly. Also the screen brightness is not very high.'),
	(3, 2, 1, 'Terrible display. Top of the display is low contrast, bottom is high. It\'s a truly terrible picture. The on-screen controls are beyond absurd.'),
	(4, 2, 1, 'I purchased this monitor to upgrade to a better monitor. I myself am a very serious pc gamer and follow the specifications seriously for the game so it may be played how it is meant to be played. I find that this monitor is perfect for the job. So I personally feel the colors are brilliant with Very slim and sleek design. The vga ports are stable. Also, the stand is not that good. The brightness maximum is painful.But inspite of these small defects, Overall, I would say a good piece.'),
	(5, 2, 1, 'i\'m a developer and our it team recently replaces my two old monitors with three of these. the price point is really good for this size/quality. the image is bright and sharp as well. i like them so much, especially at this price point, that i replaced my monitor at home with one of these even though my other monitor worked fine (was more square and a bit smaller though)'),
	(6, 2, 1, 'In my eyes, pro\'s would be good brightness, gorgeous 1080 resolution, low power consumption, Matte display. The monitor provides vga cable which works decent. The con\'s were clearly design is not good. buttons are practically hidden. Tilt is a problem.'),
	(7, 2, 1, 'I felt a bit sorry for this monitor on Amazon taking all this heat from a lack of tilting aspect and I\'m here to set the record straight. When lined up with other products, this one stands out in terms of specifications and price. For this price, it is a good buy. Once home, it connected to both my Blue Ray player and computer with ease, sp the ports work well. Picture quality was good. The only issue was the tilting aspect. I asked, How could Acer make a high-tech monitor with no tilt?! Answer is  THEY DID! the tilt feature works just fine. This is a fantastic buy, the quality is as advertised, and if your video card supports two monitors, buy a second one for a full panoramic experience. I hope you enjoy.'),
	(9, 1, 1, 'The screen of this Dell D2015HM monitor is great; the colors are rich, bright and very enjoyable.  I am very happy I bought a Dell monitor because before this Dell monitor I’ve had this monitor which you can find here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMB4KVI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EMB4KVI&linkCode=as2&tag=compinfoand01-20&linkId=OJNJAZF2EVJ2JWBJ. The monitor listed above lasted a very long time before manifesting typical signs of age. So I figured I\'d stay brand loyal and continue with this Dell monitor. Right now I am very happy I made that choice because this Dell monitor is fantastic! VGA cable does not work that well. You can download your drivers directly from the Dell website rather than the CD that comes with the monitor. This is a great monitor for this price. I have to and I\'m extremely happy with them.'),
	(10, 1, 1, 'The display works great, but you NEED VGA cable as there are NO other inputs. The default settings are not very sharp, but with the controls on the monitor and video card we were able to get it right. It\'s a good display for a secondary monitor. Additionally I do feel the stand is sturdy but not pretty. For this price, a decent monitor.'),
	(11, 1, 1, 'It works as expected, and the price was right. The brightness is bad as it is not too bright.The size did not disappoint. The display is big but hardly any controls. But it also has an auto-adjust feature which is pretty good.No surprises unpacking this monitor, it was boxed very neatly as new and everything was there. At least one reviewer mentioned the video cable being inferior, but I did not find that to be true and I\'m a 30-year IT pro. Just know it\'s analog/VGA, not digital, and it\'s as inexpensive as any name-brand monitor you\'ll find.'),
	(12, 3, 1, 'I just got it today, and so far it\'s great.The screen is really bright! I\'m actually using about 15-20% brightness for work.For now, the size is really big as I\'m used to work on a 24". I played some games and the screen is surprisingly responsive! One of them is Counter Strike Source - quite a fast-paced game, and absolutely no lag\\ghosting that I noticed. The resolution is okay, 1920x1080 looks great on 22-24". I can say that there was some light bleeding in the picture. Only one that bothered me though (middle-left). I did not notice it in games or movies, although I didn\'t play any horror movies. Overall a good purchase,especially for the price.'),
	(13, 3, 1, 'UPDATE: Three months later (late Sept 2014) - I still love this monitor -- in fact, I just bought a second one so I will be connecting two of these to my mini.Overall, I\'m pretty happy with this display - for the price, it has a nice picture, no missing pixels that I can see [your mileage may vary, of course,] and reasonably attractive design, with tilt control.'),
	(14, 3, 1, 'I recently purchased a monitor of size 27 inches from amazon. The monitor is good for this price. For this amount, it is definitely a good purchase . Brightness control does not work properly. the monitor came with the panel because of which setup was easy. colors are sharp. I am happy with this monitor.'),
	(15, 3, 1, 'The 27 inches GL2760H is a nice buy. The price offered is great. The brightness is nice and bright. It has vga and hdmi ports which are decent. Font is crisp. Overall, great deal if you get it under $180.'),
	(16, 3, 1, 'This monitor is big and has amazing colors. This monitor is great for gaming and pretty much anything you can throw at it (Don\'t literally throw something at it!). Benq always comes out with great products. The screen at this price and size is amazing and know one will be disappointed with it.'),
	(17, 1, 1, 'I ordered this monitor and it had washed out colors and reds appeared orange. I promptly decided I couldn\'t deal with that and I returned the monitor. Amazon was great at sending me another monitor as fast as possible without any gimmicks. The monitor I have now is great and colors are good. Power LED is dark blue and dim. Bottom of base is all metal which is bad. Menu is smaller and not that bright. Awesome colors. Aside from this small setback, the monitors are perfect for my setup. '),
	(24, 2, 1, 'The resolution at 1080 is great. The controls are easy to use. Quick response. Colors look bright.The design is also nice. A good buy.'),
	(25, 2, 1, 'The monitor itself arrived nicely packaged. It is light and easy to adjust the viewing angle. The brightness was a bit too much. On the whole I\'m very happy as the monitor has a nice size and functionality of this monitor is good. It does everything I was hoping, and looks very attractive on my desk. I would buy it again and I highly recommend this as a great value.'),
	(26, 2, 1, ' i like this monitor. and delivery was on time and when expected. I think this is a great monitor. Brightness is okay and the colors are not that great. maybe i just dont know how to set it up correctly but out of the box it just seems to be toned down. Also, the viewing angle is not that great . But price is great.'),
	(27, 2, 1, 'As a monitor this is not a good buy. The controls are not visible easily. I looked through the CD-ROM PDF manual for some guide to the row of these buttons, such as which one does what...and there isn\'t a guide. You\'re on your own. The design is not attractive. Colors are just okay. I would anyday prefer something else as a monitor.'),
	(28, 2, 1, ' I was looking for the biggest bang for my buck, and I definitely found it with this monitor! It took me 2 months to discover the monitor can be tilted before adding the stand, but that is beside the point. The monitor has amazing design and in my opinion has a brilliant price. Is it the best? No, but pretty darn good for what you\'re paying. I couldn\'t be happier with it! So I bought a 2nd one. The picture is excellent. There are no hdmi ports. The stand is not the best.'),
	(29, 1, 1, 'I bought 2 of them. They are very bright, and have great calibration options. The contrast is very good for a monitor in this price range. The problem is viewing angle. What I am saying is, if you are trying to look at the monitor from anything other than the perfect height and angle, the color is severely distorted. This angle is not good and has given me a little trouble.'),
	(31, 1, 1, 'The monitor is amazing in every aspect. Very lightweight, and extremely thin! I have a 10 in. tablet that has a similar weight to these monitors. The calibration options are good, and has all the possible functions for special tweaks. Overall a good buy for this price.'),
	(32, 1, 1, 'This is exactly what I needed. I bought this to go with a new desktop computer. It\'s the first monitor I\'ve purchased. The setup is easy and quick. Gets going really fast. Super easy to plug in and go. The size is nice and comfortable. Nice improvement from the 17 inch laptop I\'m used to. Brightness is comfortable and doesn\'t hurt my eyes. Graphics is decent.'),
	(34, 1, 1, 'Colors are not stable. Only at an angle colors look good. Rest is nice. For the price, it is close to a perfect buy. I bought two of them for my home office. They are well made and look great !. You can\'t adjust the height but for me this isn\'t an issue. The size is just perfect and the panel is good to see., and viewing documents, as well as surfing the web, or watching videos on them is really great. I would definitely recommend.'),
	(35, 3, 1, ' Excellent monitor. I bought this to use with my Xbox One and I am impressed. Setup is as easy as any other monitor. Package came one day earlier than expected and the packaging was double boxed. The bottom of the base has a few rubber grips that will keep the monitor from sliding easily on the desk. The navigation buttons on the monitor are easy to use and it is easy to navigate the menu. There is a cd that comes with the unit that has the manual and instructions on how to use the monitor if needed. So far I have not needed it because it is easy to use. The picture is great and all I needed to do was plug and play.'),
	(36, 3, 1, 'The design of the monitor is just amazing. The vga port is not good. Right now I am using DVI like on my older LED monitor. I do wish the monitor sat just a hair shorter but that might just be because I am a shorter female. The monitor it\'s self looks nice no problems so far but I guess it doesn\'t really blow me away like I was hoping for. It is alot bigger than my last monitor which was 22" so it took some getting used to at 27".'),
	(37, 3, 1, 'I have a 10 year old 20" BenQ at 1680 x 1050. So I decided to go for this monitor. Colors are washed out and settings are not clear. This replaced a 24" same model that stopped working after 10 months. It seems this review is reminiscent of many other reviews I ignored. Please don\'t buy this product. You get what you pay for unfortunately.'),
	(38, 3, 1, 'The GL2760H arrived in a well packed compact box completely unharmed. The setup was very easy (a small child could have figured it out.) As far as the monitor itself is concerned, I really enjoy the sleek design and the hidden buttons on the side; even the on off light is hidden, so as to no detract from your gaming experience. Controls are placed well. Not to miss, the price is nice! Overall, I am happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this product to others who are looking for a gaming monitor.'),
	(39, 3, 1, 'This monitor is okay at best. It has great price and perfect size but once i got it all plugged in and set up, the picture was really bad. I first used it for my xbox 360 and xbox one but i quickly realized that the picture quality was awful. Picture was not crisp and definitely not clear in any shape or form.'),
	(41, 24, 1, 'Been using this bad boy for a couple months now and I have to say for the money you will not find a better overall monitor. It has been the perfectly priced. The color is pretty good, nice and vivid with an excellent viewing angle. The brightness and contrast are more than acceptable as well. The panel is lovely. It\'s slim with a nice thin bezel and an interesting base. Overall an excellent monitor for the price.'),
	(42, 24, 1, 'This is a good price for the quality involved. It\'s surprisingly hard to find a monitor that accepts vga at a low price point. I\'m happy, as are many other people I see from the reviews. I wanted to say one thing to help people in the future. I was using this as an extra monitor for my MacBook Pro. the vga setting is  a problem. Rest works fine. Overall am satisfied.'),
	(46, 24, 1, 'Perfect! I was amazed at the quality of these monitors being that I selected the based on this brilliant price. The resolution is amazing. The stand is good and the monitors themselves don\'t feel like plastic junk. I am thinking about adding a 3rd one to my work station. I definitely would recommend this monitor, especially if you are hooking multiple together like me for video and photo editing.'),
	(50, 24, 1, 'I recently bought this monitor to use as a TV during a year abroad. And I am so glad I did. Instead of having to buy an expensive TV from a local store, a TV I would then have to sell at steep discount, I bought this monitor. I then paired it with my Amazon Fire Stick and Amazon Alexa Speaker and the three work great together. Please keep in mind the monitor has no speaker, no audio output, and no internal Bluetooth, so the audio pretty much must come from elsewhere; in my case, I have paired my Fire Stick with Alexa. So, the audio is a problem. The picture is great, enhanced by HP technology, and the monitor can be tilted up and down, from 90 to 45 degrees. But overall this monitor is just awesome for the price.'),
	(53, 24, 1, 'HP really stepped up their game. This is a great stylish monitor for $99 dollars! Brilliant design and a brilliant price. I\'m using this as my secondary monitor with my 21" iMac. I am a web developer so having this extra monitor allows me to work on my main monitor while viewing the pages on the HP. Overall the monitor is great. No dead pixels, the font is sharp. It came well packaged and easy to setup (no screws necessary). I bought 2 of this monitor! One for my coworker and he loves it as well!! If my review was in any way helpful please click the \'YES\' button.'),
	(58, 24, 1, 'The monitor has a moderate 21.5 display. The monitor has good viewing angles and no glare. I didn\'t do much gaming, but the refresh rate seemed fine when watching videos. The only thing I cannot seem too happy about is the color. Color is bland and boring. All in all, it gets the job done, but I wouldn\'t recommend this to anyone who consumes content on a regular basis. Not a vibrant, luscious display.'),
	(60, 24, 1, 'Bought this with my new tower, and I love it! Clean and crisp picture, Nice lighting and over all just a great product. I know some people got the broken pixels on their screens but I seemed to have lucked out. My only beef with the product would be that the stand likes to fall off when I tilt the screen forward to adjust wires and such and it landed on my toe when I went to my room with it to hook it up, but it\'s just fine when placed right and left alone.'),
	(62, 24, 1, 'The screen is clear and responsive, it really helps with my work. My only complaint would be the fact that when you connect it with the VGA connection it requires you to have it auto align it in the monitor\'s built in settings. Other than that I would not have anything else except maybe the fact the resolution is a bit lower than I expected but it works well for what I do with it and it is totally customizable without even installing the help utility that comes with it. It is a great addition to my desk and I honestly would not hesitate to buy a second one.'),
	(71, 24, 1, 'This is a great upgrade from my previous HP Monitor. Great design, vibrant colors. visibility is nice due to its good resolution. It does what its intended to do. I am pleased with price.'),
	(73, 24, 1, 'A good monitor with an attractive design. To start, the semigloss, half-matte-half-glossy panel is truly very nice. Brightness, contrast, and color are also quite good. The addition of decent embedded speakers would have been a nice touch, but alas $200 can only get you so far. So, all in all, there are a few shortcomings that keep this from being a truly 5-star product, but they\'re all related to the very reasonable limitations that make this monitor sub-$250. Even with those items in mind, there\'s very little to dislike here.'),
	(74, 25, 1, 'Great monitor for work. I have the 2 connected to my DELL XPS laptop via a DELL USB docking station. I deal with a lot of spread sheets and many programming windows here at my home office when I\'m not out in the field so its a major improvement for me to move from trying to cram all that stuff into a 15 inch laptop but now I have enough space. The screen seems very sturdy and well built. The matte finish is good for me as I have a lot of windows and light coming in so no glare as compared to the glossy finish of my laptop display. I will say though that the black are not as deep as my XPS lap top display and the colors are not a vivid either. But for my use they work out very well. I think if I were using them for watching movies. But for my purpose they work out great so I\'m very happy.'),
	(77, 25, 1, 'This monitor not only met my expectations, but it exceeded them. I got this as one of Amazon\'s Gold Box Deals for under a $100. I picked up two for my gaming PC and figured if they weren\'t any good, I could just use them for something else. After using them for two months, I can say these are probably the best monitors I\'ve bought. The color looks great, the setup was super easy for it. the price is just outstanding. If you see it for anywhere close to the $100 range, get it. You won\'t be disappointed.'),
	(78, 25, 1, 'The Samsung S24E310HL is a good monitor if all you\'re doing is basic web browsing. The design is nice and simple. But once you start to play back any type of video or movie it starts to go down hill from here. For gaming, monitor is not at all good. I contacted Samsung with my issue. The only option is eye saver mode. Colors are washed out. Picture quality is bad. I\'m surprised most people haven\'t picked up on the issue.'),
	(80, 25, 1, ' I am not happy with the quality of this screen. the price is decent. I cant expect more form it. It needs manual adjustment for a long time to achieve an acceptable condition. The screen glares and watching it for longer time will hurt eyes. Picture is not that great. But it is OK for just watching videos. But one particular technical fault is intolerable. The VGA interface often does not work. It will work for one or two days, but fails after the laptop is left unattended. As I mentioned, I am using Amazon basics ports and converters, so either Amazon Basics sucks or this monitor sucks.'),
	(81, 25, 1, 'Monitor was a significant improvement to the two 21" led HP\'s I was using. Picture quality is great. I haven\'t noticed any where behavior while playing any of my video games. The setup is easy. Monitor\'s easily mounted to a desk mounting frame I bought along with these monitors. Only one complaint, the design is weird. The monitor is too close to its base. '),
	(82, 25, 1, ' The design is annoying. The settings are a pain. I could not set any of them easily. The stand is weak, , I had to hold the monitor when I turned off the monitor. I have had many Samsung monitors before, but they missed the boat on this one. I looks like that they were trying to save product cost. '),
	(83, 25, 1, 'This model is good, as is generally true for all Samsung flatscreens I have had, but it does not have all the features that you could get from other models for this amount. As such, the price is just OK.The base does not tilt, which surprised me. It has a mechanical switch on the back rather than the surface touch front controls of similar model numbers, so even though this model has a higher model number and letter code than one I had, it is not better than the older unit I own. It just does not make sense. Poor design ! '),
	(84, 25, 1, 'really pretty screen. I don’t have to put any pressure to switch on the screen. The brightness is impressive. Setup is not too hard. Also, am an old 61 year old woman with arthritis in her hands, to put together, anyone can find it easy. Brilliant price.'),
	(87, 25, 1, 'I picked this up at Best Buy about two months ago after my LCD monitor died. Its a great deal. The screen is bright and clear. It didn\'t come with a HDMI cable so I bought one for cheap at the store. The 1080 resolution is brilliant. monitor is great for playing games and watching video\'s!'),
	(88, 25, 1, 'I love this monitor! The screen is Very bright and clear. The design is not that good. The controls are weirdly placed. I wish it was on the front, but it is still pretty easy to learn. I had no problems tilting the monitor as some others seem to have had. Very happy with this purchase and much nicer than the monitor I replaced. I must say a great deal at a great price.'),
	(89, 26, 1, ' I bought two of these monitors a few weeks ago and they\'ve been pretty great so far. The best part in my opinion is the thin stand which is accurately depicted in the pictures above. The base is pretty stable. Under normal circumstances, the image quality is great. The price is okay. '),
	(90, 26, 1, 'I purchased 2 of these a few weeks ago and have enjoying the hell out of them ever since. The sleek design was a big selling point for me. A wow price for a full 1080P monitor. Has Wonderful picture . Calibration is easy. Looks great with room lights on or off. It has a very sturdy base and high viewing angles. Comes with 3 different input ports make this a dream for compatibility. '),
	(92, 26, 1, ' It has a gorgeous screen. The setup is super easy. It only includes VGA cable which is bad.The screen was impressing. The size seems perfect. The screen is quite stunning. The screen itself is low-reflective, matte. The colors are vibrant. the image is crisp. The ring shaped stand is impressive. This design is brilliant, with a beautiful screen and a stand that doesn’t waste space. Five stars.'),
	(96, 26, 1, 'I love this monitor. the screen is sleek. the round stand is great. also,  the screen itself is radiant. I use it as second monitor for my laptop, connected via VGA and it looks wonderful. The size is great. Picture clarity is amazing .the design is very stylish. I am in love with it'),
	(98, 26, 1, 'If you\'re looking for a budget HD monitor (non-4K), look no further! The Acer R240HY 23.8-inch is probably the most value for money monitor you can find online. Price could not be better. I have this for several weeks now and can tell you that the widescreen display is quality at this price point. Also, the blue light filter that\'s included is a life savior for anyone who uses electronics on a daily basis.'),
	(100, 26, 1, 'Despite the backlight bleeding, I have really enjoyed using this monitor. I use it for personal digital content creation, gaming at 1080p 60hz,and general PC browsing. The low-blue setting is easy on the eyes for extended work sessions. For the price, it is an amazing monitor. It is not a "professional" monitor, but a great PC monitor I\'d recommend to more casual gamers or freelancers on a budget. Thin base, good design, sharp screen, great IPS viewing angles, decent color, and all the inputs I need.'),
	(102, 26, 1, 'I bought the 23.8-inch to use as the main monitor in a dual-montior setup. This is a very nice monitor especially for the price. The setup was easy. Stand is light. the colors are vibrant and bright. I did have to do some small calibration to get the coloration to my liking, but it was very simple to adjust. I am happy with my purchase and recommend!'),
	(103, 26, 1, 'This is an ok monitor as compared to the other ones I have bought over the past 20 years. The picture quality is ok.  it has an annoying habit of going black for 2-5 seconds and then coming back. Also, it also sometimes gets fuzzy for a 1-2 second at random times as well. I may have gotten a bad one but this is one of their low end monitors so you never know. '),
	(104, 26, 1, 'Poor quality, but good price. Would work fine as a productivity monitor, not for gaming or any enthusiast use. Get a G-Sync, or at least a 144hz monitor. The picture quality is horrible.'),
	(106, 26, 1, 'Images are crisp. Color contrast is great. Slim design. Good for watching videos and playing games. Fairly stable. . No built in speakers. Overall a good deal'),
	(107, 27, 1, 'I have got to say it\'s one awesome monitor. The display is a treat .  the calibration is perfect. the viewing angles are superb. It is great for gaming. Ultra wide IPS is something I will never trade up again after using this monitor for rocket league and Battlefield. The colors are vibrant. The resolution is excellent.'),
	(110, 27, 1, 'This is the most budget friendly monitor in LG\'s UM (Ultrawide Monitor) series. I wanted to try an ultra-wide monitor for work, and so far this monitor is fitting the bill superbly. Screen is great, it\'s a real life/work changer. I was a little skeptical at first, but I needed a new monitor anyways and I was getting tired of switching between tabs and windows. Great IPS panel screen. Accurate colors and angles. Overall good monitor for a good price.'),
	(112, 27, 1, 'I bought this because my work monitors are terrible and I needed something new. It does its just phenomenally. Colors are amazing, view angles excellent, no light bleed, easy to setup. Just everything about it is excellent. I really like this monitor.'),
	(113, 27, 1, 'It\'s a solid screen.  I noticed it got weird stains on it very easily, in no time. And I am not fond of a dirty screen.  Overall looks good for the price so I\'m happy with it.'),
	(115, 27, 1, 'Price is affordable and great. I loved it so much that I bought two! The colors are amazing and accurate. The design is thin and elegant. The viewing angles are amazing. I game on these monitors all the time and even though they are only 60hz and a 5ms response time they are still amazing. I would recommend these to anybody looking for a great IPS monitor for productivity and gaming.'),
	(116, 27, 1, 'the size is not good. It is not good for work or movies. I returned it.'),
	(117, 27, 1, 'Terrible picture quality. I don\'t know if this was specific to the Macbook Air laptop I was plugging in, but it immediately went back in the box and was returned. If you need this for photo or video editing, this is not the monitor for you.'),
	(118, 27, 1, ' Awesome product at a great price. it\'s a pretty compact design. I highly recommend this display, mostly for its exception bang for buck value and great screen quality.'),
	(119, 27, 1, 'Amazing monitor for the price. VERY crisp and good colors, great for editing side-by-side documents. At default settings the font is a little small for my eyes, and the font could be adjusted up. The pixel density is high enough that older eyes might need to make this adjustment, creating a little less screen real estate. Still, plenty of room on the monitor. The screen is not adjustable, so we put a book under it to get it to proper height. Also, the screen, while very wide, is not very tall.'),
	(120, 27, 1, 'Beautiful monitor. The design is nice. Takes a little getting used to for the widescreen but you will not want to go back to standard after having one! Occasionally I play skyrim and it looks amazing! Colors are amazing. all the features this monitor has makes it the best monitor for the price! I am very satisfied with it. And it looks amazing sitting on my desk.'),
	(131, 40, 1, 'Great price. The design is Visually impressive and pleasing. Stand is very slim. Can be used with or without the stand. The panel is design is a bit weird. Overall a good deal.'),
	(132, 40, 1, 'Very good quality and great price too!'),
	(133, 40, 1, 'I use 3 of those. I do a lot of gaming . colors are brilliant on this monitor. I set up 3 monitors and I haven\'t been disappointed. The quality is outstanding.'),
	(134, 40, 1, 'Works well. The design looks sleek. Not a big fan of the behind the monitor buttons, wish it was at least on the side like some Dell monitors. Brightness is also decent. For $the price, a good monitor.'),
	(135, 40, 1, 'This is good for $99 price. When building my desktop I went over budget, so I decided to buy two of the cheapest but still tolerable 1080p monitors I could find and swap them out later. But after a couple months of use, I\'m very pleasantly surprised and in absolutely no rush to replace these. I now plan on keeping them until 4k content is significantly more widespread, which will probably be years.  It\'s kind of wobbly. I don\'t think it\'s terrible, but I do normally keep one against the wall of my desk hutch and the other in direct contact with the first, so this probably helps mitigate that. I really only notice it if something bumps into the desk with a decent amount of momentum. The angle is a bit difficult to control.'),
	(136, 40, 1, 'there are no vga ports or speakers. The color is average. It is definitely not substandard, but if I were still doing work I would not be satisfied with these monitors. It has a cheap price. '),
	(137, 40, 1, 'This is a truly fantastic price. Display is crisp. I deliberately chose a smaller monitor not only to fit my desk but also because 1080p on, say, 27 Inches starts to become a bit lackluster. I don\'t have that problem here at all. It is slim and sleek in design. Simple setup. That\'s true for most monitors, so this isn\'t a critical point, but this one was particularly quick.'),
	(138, 40, 1, 'The price is very good for a 1080p monitor. The thin screen is also impressive.'),
	(139, 40, 1, 'It still has a border, just not a frame around the edges. The design is classy, but the image does not extend. Easy setup, easy to use, and crisp image.'),
	(140, 40, 1, 'Very good price. The screen is very sharp and clear. The edge of the screen is very small .the stand is sturdy. Overall I have no complaints.');
